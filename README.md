# Pandas vs PyArrow vs DuckDB & CSV vs Parquet files

In this project, I explored the difference in runtime and storage when using Pandas vs PyArrow vs DuckDB and CSV vs Parquet files, as well as some of these tools' capabilities.

The data used was from Kaggle: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/geraldooizx/g-coffee-shop-transaction-202307-to-202506](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/geraldooizx/g-coffee-shop-transaction-202307-to-202506). It consists of synthetically generated coffee shop transactions spanning July 2023 to June 2025.
